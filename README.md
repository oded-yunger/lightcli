# lightcli
## this project is a remake of my very first startup project, from the year 2000.

its goals are to:
1) inspire first timers
2) empower trained developers
3) maximize useability and efficiency

# The list of lightcli parts :-

## KLUMmoza content structures
content is queen!
here we define what, where, when and which way we get new content from.

## KLUMmark ui elements
next comes the presentation layer =)
how should we display the content ?
- a stream of plain text with annotations ?
- use a common pre-defined component ?
- create our own custom renderer ?

## KLUMmuza content creation
basic forms builder for getting user feedback, or for publishing new content to a stream

## KLUMmapa content transformations
content mapping options :-
1) get a subset of a content structure
2) transform one structure to another
3) merge two structures

## KLUMmada content extensions
customize content rendering using regular expressions and rules
for example:
- search for @twitterusername and link it to the user stream
- search for #twitterhashtag and link it to a hashtag stream

## KLUMmore compound values
add endpoint runtime operations that use your content as a data source
to modify the look and feel of your content, and even generate new content on the fly

## KLUMmipo account services
- common login support for identity providers (google, facebook, twitter, etc.)
- choose a custom identity provider
- enable anonymous accounts

## KLUMmeod library services
allow the user to add your content to their private library

## KLUMcode runtime behaviour
add event handling functions to the client to customize your component behaviour

## KLUMmima access services
define content access rules based on the active user's roles
